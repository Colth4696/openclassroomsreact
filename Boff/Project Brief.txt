Project Brief


Summary: 
For the Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival 2018, I chose to go with a Grindhouse theme. Grindhouse is an American term for a theater that mainly shows exploitation films. All of the movies are the top classics from the era. With the addition of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’ most recent renditions of the Grindhouse genre. Each of the four nights there will be two showings, one at 6:00pm and one at 9:00pm. Grindhouse may not be suitable for children under a certain age. Kid appropriate options will be shown on a different screen.
